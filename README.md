# Miniature Painting Planner

## Purpose
A digital tool to plan, review and compare miniature painting concepts before applying them to physical models.

## Core Idea
Painters can visually compare variants (A/B) of a miniature paint scheme in a read-only review screen.

## MVP Scope (Sprint 1)
- Review screen
- Side-by-side comparison of two variants
- Read-only mode
- Tablet-first layout

## Out of Scope (for now)
- Painting execution
- Tutorials
- Community features
